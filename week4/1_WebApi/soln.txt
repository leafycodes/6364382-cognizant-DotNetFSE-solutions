RESTful Web Service:  REST (Representational State Transfer) is a way to design web services that focuses on simplicity and using existing web standards.

Key points:
- Stateless: Each request from client to server must contain all needed information (server doesn't remember past requests)
- Uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Resources are identified by URLs (like /products/1)
- Can return data in JSON or XML format (JSON is more common now)

Web API: A Web API is like a menu that tells other programs how to work with your application:

- Uses HTTP protocol for communication
- Follows REST principles when designed properly
- Returns data in JSON or XML format
- Each function in the API is called an "endpoint"

Microservice: Microservices are a way to build applications as small, independent pieces:

- Each microservice handles one specific job
- Services can be developed and updated separately
- They talk to each other using simple messages (usually over HTTP)
- Each service has its own database

Differences Between Web Service and Web API:
- Web Services (SOAP) always use XML, while Web APIs usually use JSON
- Web APIs are generally simpler and more flexible
- Microservices are like small Web APIs that work together

HTTP Request: When you call a Web API, you send a request with:
- A method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- A URL (like https://website.com/api/products)
- Optional headers (extra information like authorization)
- Optional body (data you're sending, like product details)

HTTP Response: The API sends back:
- A status code (200 = OK, 404 = Not Found, etc.)
- Optional headers
- Usually a body with the data you requested (in JSON format)

HTTP Methods (Action Verbs):
- GET - Retrieve information (like getting a product list)
- POST - Create new information (like adding a new product)
- PUT - Update existing information (full update)
- DELETE - Remove information (like deleting a product)

HTTP Status Codes:
- 200 OK - Everything worked
- 201 Created - New item was created successfully
- 204 No Content - Action succeeded but no data to return
- 400 Bad Request - Something was wrong with your request
- 401 Unauthorized - You need to log in first
- 404 Not Found - The item you requested doesn't exist
- 500 Internal Server Error - Something went wrong on the server
