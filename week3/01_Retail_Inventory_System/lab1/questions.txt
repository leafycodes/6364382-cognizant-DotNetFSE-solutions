1. What is ORM?

    ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) is a programming technique that:
    - Maps C# classes to database tables
    - Converts class properties to table columns
    - Translates object relationships to foreign keys

    Benefits:
    - Increased productivity (less SQL to write)
    - Better maintainability (changes in one place)
    - Database abstraction (switch DBs easily)
    - Type safety (compile-time checks)
